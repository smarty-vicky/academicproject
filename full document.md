1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 ABOUT THE PROJECT
There is a growing demand for smart systems nowadays where provided services can be improved using modern technologies of sensing, communication,
high computing performance, signal processing and multimedia. Such technologies can be utilized to improve ambulance and emergency services.
 A fuzzy logic -based system was proposed in to manage the nearby hospital for emergency.
The objective of the proposed system is to minimize the ambulance and public travel time.
A fuzzy logic -based system was proposed in to manage the nearest hospital for patient was in sick.
 The proposed system is used to minimize the finding the sick related nearest hospitals.
The authors proposed an algorithm to minimize the ambulance drop-off time.
When a patient requests ambulance and public, the closest hospital deploys an ambulance to the patient.
 These limitations make the work less practical in general situations and restrict its outcomes to small cities with uniformed conditions and uniform distribution of city inhabitants and uniform distribution of resources at the urban hospitals.
 The algorithm does not take into consideration the patients’ locations.
 The authors assume that ambulance and public requests are lost if they arrive while no ambulance is available.
 We proposed a novel algorithm that uses smart health technology in ambulance service to minimize the response time (time from receiving the request to the arrival of the ambulance at the patient’s location) and to minimize the door-to-needle time which is the sum of the delivery time (from the patient’s location to the hospital) and the waiting time (at the hospital).

2. SYSTEM ANALYSIS
2.1 EXISTING SYSTEM
The existing system is used manual. Due to meet an accident, road traffic becomes jam. The Smart Ambulance System for Highlighting Emergency-Routes are destroyed so that there left no way of reach the hospital. One other major problem that is faced during the unknown location is that the people have no idea where to shift, which road they should select to move to a shortest reach location. Because in such a situation nobody exactly knows what is happening to find the location. 
2.1.1 DRAWBACKS OF EXISTING SYSTEM
⦁	The people’s are watching the accident are happen.
⦁	The Ambulance are destroying to reach the exact location.
⦁	The local people don’t have the knowledge of calling ambulance.
⦁	Getting help is so hard.
⦁	Manually setups are badly damage if they wanted time.














2.2 PROPOSED SYSTEM 
The aim of the proposed system is the overcome the difficulties of the existing system. In this system can help residents in the area be prepared to face the existing points including moving to a safe place. Users are help the sick person through this website and the volunteerly are view the users details and they can come and help the affected peoples.
2.2.1 ADVANTAGES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM
⦁	The required information can be secured easily.
⦁	Time will not be wasted in the process.
⦁	Getting help is so easily.
⦁	People have been shifted to the safer places.















SOFTWARE FEATURES
About PHP
	PHP is a powerful server-side scripting language for creating dynamic and interactive websites. PHP widely used; free and efficient alternative to competitors such as Microsoft’s ASP.PHP is perfectly suited for Web development and can be embedded directly into the HTML code. The PHP syntax is similar to pearl and C.
	PHP is open source that it is readily available and absolutely free. Stability, flexibility and speed are chief qualities that attract to choose PHP.PHP have multiple extensions and is extremely scalable. 
Server-side scripting
	This server-side scripting is the most traditional and main target field for PHP. Programmer needs three things to make this work. Programmer need to run the web server, with a connected PHP installation. Programmer can access the PHP program output with a web browser, viewing the PHO page through the server. All these can run on your home machine if programmers are just experimenting with PHP programming.
Command line scripting
	Programmer can make a PHP script to run it without any server or browser. Programmers only need the PHP parser to use it this way. This type of usage is ideal for scripts regularly executed using croon (on*nix or Linux) or Task Scheduler (on Windows). These scripts can also be used for simple text processing tasks.
Features of PHP
⦁	PHP runs on different platforms (Windows, Linux, UNIX, etc.)
⦁	PHP is compatible with almost all servers used today.
⦁	PHP is free to download from the official PHP resource: www.php.net.
About MYSQL
MYSQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) is developed, distributed and supported by MYSQL AB. MYSQL is a popular choice of database for use in web applications MYSQL can be scaled by deploying it on more powerful hardware, such as a multi-processor server with gigabytes of memory. MYSQL is easy to use, yet extremely powerful, secure, and scalable. And because of its small size and speed, it is the ideal database solution for Web sites.  
MYSQL is a database management system
A database is a structured collection of data. It may be anything from a simple shopping list to a picture gallery or the vast amount of information in a corporation network. To add, access and process data stored in a computer database we need a database management system such as MYSQL server. Since computers are very good at handling large amount of data, database management system plays a central role in computing.
MYSQL is a relational database management system
 	A relational database stores separate data in separate tables rather than putting all the data in one big storeroom. This adds speed and flexibility. The SQL part of “MYSQL” stands for “Structured Query Language”. SQL is the most common standardize language used to access database and is defined by the ANSI/ISO SQL standard. The SQL standard has been evolving since 1986 and several versions exist.
MYSQL software is open source
Open source means that it is possible for anyone to use modify the software. Anybody can download the MYSQL software uses the GPL (GNU General Public License), to define what we may and may not use do with the software. 
MYSQL Server works in Client/ Server or embedded systems
The MYSQL database software is a client/server system that consists of a multi-threaded SQL server that supports different backend, several different client programs and libraries, administrative tools and a wide range of Application Programming Interface (APIs). A large amount of contributed MYSQL software is available:
 Modern day websites seem to be relying more and more on compel the Structured Query Language is a very popular database language, and its standardization makes it easy to store, update and access data. One of the most powerful SQL servers out there is called MYSQL and surprisingly enough, it’s free.
Some of the features of MYSQL include: Handles large databases, in the area of 50,000,000+records. No memory leaks. Tested with a commercial memory leakage detector (purify). A privilege and password system which is very flexible and secure, and which allows host-based verification. Passwords are secure since all password traffic when connecting the server is encrypted.

Features of MYSQL
Client/server Architecture: MYSQL is a client/server system. There is a database server (MYSQL) and arbitrarily many clients (application programs), which communicate with the server. The clients can run on the same computer as the server or on another computer.
SQL Compatibility: As before said SQL is a standardized language for querying and updating data and for the administration of a database. Through the configuration setting sol-mode we can make the MYSQL server behave for the most part compatibly with various database systems.
Stored procedures: Stored procedures (SPs for short) are generally used to simplify steps such as inserting or deleting a data record. 
Triggers: Triggers are SQL commands that are automatically executed by the server in certain database operations INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, MYSQL has supported triggers. 
            Replication: Replication allows the contents of a database to be copied (replicated) onto a number of computers to increase protection against system and to improve the speed of database queries.
      	Platform independence: MYSQL can be executed under a number of operating systems. The most important are Apple Macintosh OS X, Linux, Microsoft Windows, and the Unix.
Speed: MYSQL is considered a very fast database program.










3. SYSTEM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
3.1 FILE DESIGN
System design is the process of planning a new system to complement or altogether replace the old system. The purpose of the design phase is the first step in moving from the problem domain to the solution domain. The design of the system is the critical aspect that affects the quality of the software. System design is also called top-level design. The design phase translates the logical aspects of the system into physical aspects of the system.
3.2 INPUT DESIGN
The data, which is input to a computer – based information system, must be correct. If data is carelessly input and errors enter the system, it will lead to incorrect results whose consequences will be expensive and embarrassing to the designer. In data processing, the data entry operator often makes errors. This can be controlled by input design by using menu, interactive dialogue, consistent format etc.
In this system the users are provided with user friendly pages to give the input and if the user gives any wrong input validations are done and message boxes are provided in the necessary places. The message specified in the message box is specified in a polite and in an informative manner. 
System is interactive dialogue, which simplifies the data entry or access, instead of remembering what to enter. User can choose from a list of options and type it in the cursor position. This will reduce the number of corrections while entering the data.
3.3 DATABASE DESIGN
The database design involves creation of tables that are represented in physical database as stored files. They have their own existence. Each table constitute of rows and columns where each row can be viewed as record that consists of related information and column can be viewed as field of data of same type. The table is also designed with some position can have a null value.
The database design of project is designed in such a way values are kept without redundancy and with normalized format. Refer the appendix for screen shots of database design.



3.4 OUTPUT DESIGN
	The proposed system is a web oriented system and hence it does not provide any reports. The output results are viewed in the web pages itself. Outputs from the computer system are required primarily to communicate the result of processing to users. They are also used to override a permanent copy of the results for later consultation. The output reports and input documents should be documented in terms of data content and approximate layout; it is not necessary to define the methods of presentation. It is possible to work back for the output data items are derived by calculations or by logical deduction.











4. SYSTEM TESTING AND IMPLEMENTATION
4.1 TESTING
	Testing is a series of different tests that whose primary purpose is to fully exercise the computer based system. Although each test has a different purpose, all work should verify that all system element have been properly integrated and performed allocated function. Testing is the process of checking whether the developed system works according to the actual requirement and objectives of the system.
	The philosophy behind testing is to find the errors. A good test is one that has a high probability of finding an undiscovered error. A successful test is one that uncovers the undiscovered error. Test cases are devised with this purpose in mind. A test case is a set of data that the system will process as an input. However the data are created with the intent of determining whether the system will process them correctly without any errors to produce the required output.
Types of Testing
⦁	Unit testing
⦁	Integration testing
⦁	Validation testing
⦁	Output testing
⦁	User acceptance testing
⦁	White box testing
⦁	Black box testing
Unit Testing
All modules were tested and individually as soon as they were completed and were checked for their correct functionality.
Integration Testing
The entire project was split into small program; each of these single programs gives a frame as an output. These programs were tested individually; at last all these programs where combined together by creating another program where all these constructors were used. It give a lot of problem by not functioning is an integrated manner.
The user interface testing is important since the user has to declare that the arrangements made in frames are convenient and it is satisfied. When the frames where given for the test, the end user gave suggestion. Based on their suggestions the frames where modified and put into practice.
Validation Testing
        At the culmination of the black box testing software is completely assembled as a package. Interfacing errors have been uncovered and corrected and a final series of test i.e., Validation succeeds when the software function in a manner that can be reasonably accepted by the customer.
Output Testing
  	After performing the validation testing the next step is output testing of the proposed system. Since the system cannot be useful if it does not produce the required output. Asking the user about the format in which the system is required tests the output displayed or generated by the system under consideration. Here the output format is considered in two ways. One is on screen and another one is printed format. The output format on the screen is found to be corrected as the format was designed in the system phase according to the user needs. And for the hardcopy the output comes according to the specifications requested by the user.
White box testing
	White box testing (also known as Clear Box Testing, Open Box Testing, Glass Box Testing, Transparent Box Testing, Code-Based Testing or Structural Testing) is a software testing method in which the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is known to the tester. The tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determines the appropriate outputs.
Programming know-how and the implementation knowledge is essential. White box testing is testing beyond the user interface and into the nitty-gritty of a system.
This method is named so because the software program, in the eyes of the tester, is like a white/transparent box; inside which one clearly sees.
Definition by ISTQB
⦁	White-box testing: Testing based on an analysis of the internal structure of the component or system.
⦁	White-box test design technique: Procedure to derive and/or select test cases based on an analysis of the internal structure of a component or system.
Black box testing
Black box testing, also known as Behavioral Testing, is a software testing method in which the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is not known to the tester. These tests can be functional or non-functional, though usually functional.
This method is named so because the software program, in the eyes of the tester, is like a black box; inside which one cannot see. This method attempts to find errors in the following categories:
⦁	Incorrect or missing functions
⦁	Interface errors
⦁	Errors in data structures or external database access
⦁	Behavior or performance errors
⦁	Initialization and termination errors
Definition by ISTQB
⦁	Black box testing: Testing, either functional or non-functional, without reference to the internal structure of the component or system.
⦁	Black box test design technique: Procedure to derive and/or select test cases based on an analysis of the specification, either functional or non-functional, of a component or system without reference to its internal structure.
Acceptance testing
This testing is done to verify the readiness of the system for the implementation. Acceptance testing begins when the system is complete. Its purpose is to provide the end user with the confidence that the system is ready for use. It involves planning and execution of functional tests, performance tests and stress tests in order to demonstrate that the implemented system satisfies its requirements. Tools to special importance during acceptance testing include:
Test coverage Analyzer
	Records the control paths followed for each test case.
Timing Analyzer
	Also called a profiler, reports the time spent in various regions of the code are areas to concentrate on to improve system performance.


4.2 SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation is the stage in the project where the theoretical design is turned into a working system and is giving confidence on the new system for the users that it will work efficiently and effectively. It involves careful planning, investigation of the current system and its constraints on implementation, design of methods to achieve the change over, an evaluation of change over methods. Apart from planning major task of preparing the implementation are education and training of users. The implementation process begins with preparing a plan for the implementation of the system. 
According to this plan, the activities are to be carried out, discussions made regarding the equipment and resources and the additional equipment has to be acquired to implement the new system. In network backup system no additional resources are needed. Implementation is the final and the most important phase. The most critical stage in achieving a successful new system is giving the users confidence that the new system will work and be effective. The system can be implemented only after thorough testing is done and if it is found to be working according to the specification. This method also offers the greatest security since the old system can take over if the errors are found or inability to handle certain type of transactions while using the new system. As the part of system testing we execute the program with the intent of finding errors and missing operations and also a complete verification to determine whether the objectives are met and the user requirements are satisfied. The ultimate aim is quality assurance.











5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
5.1 CONCLUSION
The main objective of the project is to bring a full-fledged computerized organization, and to enable the transaction details to maintain records, which makes of the employees easier. Thus, the proposed system has been developed with good amount of flexibility without compromising on the response time.
	Computerization of the entire system will enhance more accuracy and reduces major part of clerical works. Fast, clear and legible reports can be generated without any ambiguity. Integrated database design and ease of maintenance is a major advantage of the system. User friendliness is a unique feather of the system. Hence by developing a system that is user-friendly in nature, many users are able to work on the system with little of computer knowledge and training.
   	 
5.2 FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
There is a wide scope for future development of the software. The world of computer fields is not static it is always subject to change. The technology which is famous today will become outdated very next day. To keep abstract of technical improvements, the system may be refinement. So it is not concluded. Yet it will improve with further enhancements.
It is essential to change the software when new software arrives with more advanced feathers. So it is much necessary for further development. Further enhancements can be done in an efficient manner with disruption to the system.
